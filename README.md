# Neural_Networks
Implement variations on Neural Network Archetypes in Python

## TODO
- [x] Make a todo-list in a GitHub README
- [ ] Use Discrete Q-Learning to optimize Neural Network Hyperparameters
- [ ] Use an evolutionary strategy to optimize network performance
- [x] Impliment a modular neural network factory using Keras
- [ ] Impliment an neural network with LSTM cells
- [x] Impliment an Variational AutoEncoder (vae)
